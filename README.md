# Recipe-Grabber
A webpage recipie maker that finds recipes based on user search

## Description

A webpage that displays a searchbox where a user can search for meal suggestions complete with recipe information and ingredients for chosen meals, the website will make external API 
calls to serve the user with a recipie and ingredient information to make the chosen meal.
We would like to add many more features to this as it has great potential, one of which might beto make the website able to create a meal from ingredients supplied by the user.
